// Runtime polymorphism or Dynamic Method Dispatch is a process in which 
// a call to an overridden method is resolved at runtime rather than compile-time.
// In this process, an overridden method is called through the reference variable of a superclass. 
// The determination of the method to be called is based on the object being referred to by the reference variable.
