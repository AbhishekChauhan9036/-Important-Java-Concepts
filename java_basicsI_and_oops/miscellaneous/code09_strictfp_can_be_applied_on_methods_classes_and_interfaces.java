// Java strictfp keyword ensures that you will get the same result on 
// every platform if you perform operations in the floating-point variable.
// The precision may differ from platform to platform that is why java 
// programming language have provided the strictfp keyword, 
// so that you get same result on every platform. 
// So, now you have better control over the floating-point arithmetic.

// The strictfp keyword can be applied on methods, classes and interfaces.

// EXAMPLES :

strictfp class A{}//strictfp applied on class  

strictfp interface M{}//strictfp applied on interface  
class A{  

strictfp void m(){}//strictfp applied on method  
}
