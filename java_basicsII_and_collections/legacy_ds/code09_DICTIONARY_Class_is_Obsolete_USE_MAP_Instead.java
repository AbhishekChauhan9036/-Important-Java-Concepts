/*
Dictionary is an abstract class that represents a key/value storage repository and operates much like Map.

Given a key and value, you can store the value in a Dictionary object. 
Once the value is stored, you can retrieve it by using its key. 
Thus, like a map, a dictionary can be thought of as a list of key/value pairs.

The Dictionary class is obsolete. 
You should implement the Map interface to obtain key/value storage functionality.
